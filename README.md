A design-first approach was adopted for the EffesEYE platform APIs. This approach produces a standards-compliant API-spec for the platform, and builds resilience, thoughtfullness, empathy, robustness, compliance, and superior developer and user experiences into the product.

> The API is the first user interface in the product

Not only are we able to generate high quality documentation, including code samples and with support for code generation for a multitude of programming languages, all from the API spec, we are also able to leverage automatic and on-the-fly validation for all inbound traffic (requests) to the EffesEYE API in production.

> An API-first approach involves developing APIs that are consistent and reusable, which can be accomplished by using an API description language to establish a contract for how the API is supposed to behave.  Establishing a contract involves spending more time thinking about the design of an API. It also often involves additional planning and collaboration with the stakeholders providing feedback on the design of an API before any code is written - swagger.io
